Hermes is a macOS agent written in Swift 5 designed for red team operations.

## Installation
Hermes currently supports Mythic 3.0.

To install Hermes, you'll need Mythic installed on a remote computer. You can find installation instructions for Mythic at the [Mythic project page](https://github.com/its-a-feature/Mythic/).

From the Mythic install directory, use the following command to install Hermes as the **root** user:

```
./mythic-cli install github https://github.com/MythicAgents/hermes.git
```

From the Mythic install directory, use the following command to install Hermes as a **non-root** user:

```
sudo -E ./mythic-cli install github https://github.com/MythicAgents/hermes.git
```

Once installed, restart Mythic to build a new agent.

## Notable Features
- Cross-compiling macOS payloads from Linux using Darling
- Ability to load and execute JXA scripts in-memory
- Various macOS situational awareness techniques
- Upload/download
- Full file system access (ls, mv, cp, mkdir, cd, etc.)

screenshot | `screenshot` | Capture all connected displays in-memory and send it back over the C2 channel, requires `Screen Recording` permissions
setenv | `setenv [name] [value]` | Set an environment variable, will overwrite existing
shell | `shell [command]` | Execute a shell command with `/bin/bash -c`
sleep | `sleep [seconds] [percentage]` | Set the callback interval of the agent in seconds with a percentage for jitter
tcc_folder_checker | `tcc_folder_checker` | Use mdquery API to check access to TCC-protected folders: `~/Downloads`, `~/Desktop`, `~/Documents`

upload | `upload` | Use modal popup to upload a file to a remote path on the target
whoami | `whoami` | Gather current user context

## Supported C2 Profiles

### [HTTP Profile](https://github.com/MythicC2Profiles/http)

The HTTP profile calls back to the Mythic server over the basic, non-dynamic profile. When selecting options to be stamped into Hermes at compile time, all options are respected with the exception of those parameters related to proxy servers.

## Feature Showcase

### Cross-Compiling macOS Payloads

The Hermes docker container allows you to cross-compile Mach-O binaries from Ubuntu using [Darling](https://github.com/darlinghq/darling). No need for external build systems, build all of your payloads directly from Mythic!

### File Triage

The `ls` command reports back a wealth of information about files/folders such as permissions, timestamps, and extended attributes. Operators can easily sort and filter files through the Mythic UI. Clicking the `ACTIONS` button will allow operators to download files directly from `ls` output. Additionally, this hooks into Mythic's native file browser.

This shows typical ls output:
![ls browserscript](documentation-payload/ls.png)

Interfaces with Mythic's filebrowser and caches data server-side:

### Process and App Listings

Hermes has two different ways to retrieve information about running processes: `ps` and `list_apps`. These both will also hook into Mythic's native process browser where you can compare process listing output and observe change over time.

This shows typical ps output: 
![ps browserscript](documentation-payload/ps.png)

This shows typical list_apps output:
![list_apps browserscript](documentation-payload/listapps.png)

Both process listing methods also interface with Mythic's builtin process browser, which allows you to see process trees more easily.

### Built-In Situational Awareness

Hermes comes with multiple situational awareness techniques built-in to help understand your current access.

This shows typical fda_check, get_execution_context, and tcc_folder_check output:

### JXA and Third-Party Script Execution

Hermes can execute arbitrary JXA and store a JXA script in-memory to execute functions from the script. This allows operators to extend Hermes capability using the wealth of macOS post-exploitation written in JXA.

This shows typical jxa, jxa_import, and jxa_call output:
![jxa all](documentation-payload/jxa.png)

### File System Interaction

Hermes has all of your classic commands for interacting with the file system:

- `mv`
- `cp`
- `mkdir`
- `rm`
- `ls`
- `cd`
- `pwd`
- `cat`

Additionally, you can `download` files from target and `upload` files to the target:
![download upload](documentation-payload/download_upload.png)

### Job Tracking

Hermes tracks all jobs with a job ID, commands, and arguments passed to the command. You can kill long-running jobs with `jobkill`

This shows typical jobs and jobkill output:
![job control](documentation-payload/jobcontrol.png)

### Environment Variable Control

Hermes has the ability to list, set, and unset environment variables.

This shows typical env, setenv, and unsetenv output:
![env all](documentation-payload/env.png)

### And more!

There's a bunch of other small features and quality of life things that I didn't list. Install the agent and check it out for yourself!
